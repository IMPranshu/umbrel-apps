  Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of.
  But with superpowers.
  Stay organized
  Organize all of your tasks in projects. Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.


  Collaborate with peers
  Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team! Assignments show who's working on what.


  Use it how you need it
  You can view your tasks in the classic list view - or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board. Whatever you need!


  Built for speed.
  We built Vikunja with speed in mind - every interaction takes less than 100ms. No more loading spinners.
  Because a productive tool should not get in your way.


  Import your tasks from Todoist, Trello or Microsoft To-Do
  Because work does not happen in one tool only.
