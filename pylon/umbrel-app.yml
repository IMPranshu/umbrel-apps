  Pylon is a web based integrated development environment built with Node.js as a backend and with a supercharged JavaScript/HTML5 frontend, licensed under GPL version 3. This project originates from Cloud9 v2 project.


  Pylon is built entirely on a web stack, making it the most hacker-friendly IDE today. Fork it, hack it, make it your own and if you think others would benefit, file a pull request against development branch in this repo or create an issue. You can run Pylon locally or on a remote server - always ready to be available from wherever you are, assisting you to breathe life into every aspect of your ideas and projects.

  Basic iPad Pro support with keyboard -


  - Efforts have been made to make Pylon usable with iPad. However, for a smoother ride, some keyboard settings needs to be changed -


  - Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Auto-Correction -> Off

  
  - Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Smart Punctuation -> Off (interferes with coding by changing quotes)


  - Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Off (interferes by displaying bottom bar that hides the console prompt)
  
  
  - For quality of life it is recommended to remap Caps Lock hardware key to act as an ESC key -

  
  
  - Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Hardware Keyboard -> Modifier Keys -> Caps Lock Key -> Escape
