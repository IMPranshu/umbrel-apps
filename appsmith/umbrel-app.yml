description: >-
  Appsmith is the open-source framework that lets your team build custom internal applications like dashboards, admin panels, CRUD apps faster, and together.


  Create a functional UI in record time with drag & drop widgets -


  Building an interface for your app could not get any quicker. Use pre-made widgets to easily layout an app, and move them around to experiment with usability.


  Plug in data from datasources you already use -


  Integrate all your datasources in minutes. Appsmith has plug-and-play support for most databases, Rest APIs and GraphQL, so you can seamlessly import your data.


  Dynamically control widgets with JavaScript -


  Modify data, adjust widget properties or call an API with JavaScript. Event listeners within Appsmith can trigger updates automatically. Use vanilla JS or bring your favourite library.


  Build better apps, together -


  Fork a branch to split the work or drop a comment to ask for help! Loop in a designer to refine the UI or ping a user to get their feedback. Appsmith was made from the ground up to be a collaborative development tool.
