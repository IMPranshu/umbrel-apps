  A remote control and remote scripting solution, built with .NET 6, Blazor, SignalR Core, and WebRTC.


  Hosting a Remotely server requires running an ASP.NET Core web app behind IIS (Windows), Nginx (Ubuntu), or Caddy Server (any OS). It's expected that the person deploying and maintaining the server is familiar with this process. Since this is a hobby project that I develop in between working full time and raising a family, there simply isn't time available to provide support in this capacity.
