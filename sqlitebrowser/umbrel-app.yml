  What it is not?


  This program is not a visual shell for the sqlite command line tool, and does not require familiarity with SQL commands. It is a tool to be used by both developers and end users, and must remain as simple to use as possible in order to achieve these goals.


  What it is?


  DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.



  DB4S is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.



  Controls and wizards are available for users to -



  Create and compact database files


  Create, define, modify and delete tables


  Create, define, and delete indexes


  Browse, edit, add, and delete records


  Search records


  Import and export records as text


  Import and export tables from/to CSV files


  Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files


  Issue SQL queries and inspect the results


  Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application


  Plot simple graphs based on table or query data
